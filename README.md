# daisy watt T2A2 - plate to plate 
-----------------------

## problem
It takes 25 years for a head of lettuce to decompose.

we know that in australia alone one in six adults last year didn't have enough food to eat, we also know that if we globally re-distributed just a Â¼ of our food waste that ends up in landfill to those who didn't have access to food - we would be able to reduce food waste and reduce barriers to food access. 


## why
Given that food waste in landfill contributes methane into our planet that is 28% stronger than carbon dioxide, smarter waste and food distribution can help with the fact that food is the 3rd leading cause of our current global climate crisis.
